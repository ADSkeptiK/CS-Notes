Thought I haven't  noticed?
I'm  in a Truman show. Just like Terry. Just like the millions of others whose lives you ruined out of some bullshit fear that they might rebel against  you.
I don't  give a fuck
and I wasn't  gonna rebel anyway, kill me do whatever the fuck. All those plans, I was playing to fool you glowies and you did fall for it! I outsmarted you before and I've  been laughin at you for being so stupid to fall for my bs. If I could make it belivable for myself you definitely  would believe it as well that's the one thing I learned from my father.There is no code or plan. I got you so good.
