Compiler: before a program can be run, it rst must be translated into a form in which it can be executed by a computer. The software systems that do this translation are called compilers.1

Interpreter: It's another common kind of language processor. Instead of producing a target program as a translation, an interpreter appears to directly execute the operations speci ed in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.2

Preprocessor:Does the task of collecting
the source program.It  may also expand
shorthands, called macros, into source
language statement

Linker:Resolves external memory addresses, where the code in one file may refer to a location in another file.3
Loader: Puts together all of the executable object files into memory for execution.3
