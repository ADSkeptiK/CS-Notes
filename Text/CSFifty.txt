65 is A. 33:00_Week0_Lecture0

We decided to use more bytes to repreasent  characters as a solution for not keeping it limited toEnglish.38:00_Week0_Lecture0

Pixels use RGBs (three bytes to repreasent the color).52:00_Week0_Lecture0

Abstraction: a simplification  so that we wouldn't  have to focus on the lower level. 56:00_Week0_Lecture0
Algorithm. 1:00:00_Week0_Lecture0.

Green flag in scratch means the start.


Cmputers use as many as 32 bits to repreasent  integers. Which is around 4 billion integers.While the highest integer is usually 2 billions because we consider negative numbers as well.

Floating point imprecision when we use too many floating digits.
We use double to improve the precision. 2:26:48_Week1_Lecture1
