Chapter 0: Preparations for C++ programming

C++ is a compiled general purpose programming language. Meaning in order to write functional programs in this language for a hardware we need:

1) Its Compiler for that specific hardware, which is an app that takes the program in  Compiled programming language and translates it into an object file.

2) A Linker which is the app that links the generated object file to the object file of the libraries,generating an executable app that could be run in the process.

3) A code editor for editing, saving and possibly changing declarations in our program.

All of these are present in IDEs for major OS s, the installation of which is pretty simple but will be explained.


Every program ultimately could be summarized into a single routine, the beginning of which is called the entry point(The literal start of the program).Entry point is defined differently based on programming languages and in C++ it's the main function which is the THE summarized single routine we spoke of in the beginning.
