position:static/relative/fixed/absolute/sticky:
Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the   position  property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value. HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.An element with position: static;  is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.relative;  is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.An element with position: absolute;  is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
Note:  Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

An element with position: sticky;  is positioned based on the user's scroll position.A sticky element toggles between relative  and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).Note:  Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example below). You must also specify at least one of   top,   right,   bottom  or   left  for sticky positioning to work. 

z-index: integer: specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others). z-index  only works onpositioned elements  (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items  (elements that are direct children of
display: flex elements).If two positioned elements overlap each other without a   z-index  specified, the element defined   last in the HTML code  will be shown on top. 
Till overflow.


overflow: visible/hidden/scroll/auto:specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area. 

visible  : Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box

hidden : The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible


scroll : The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content

auto : Similar to  scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
Note:  The   overflow  property only works for block elements with a specified height. 

overflow-x:visible/hidden/scroll:
specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content. 


overflow-y:visible/hidden/scroll:specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content. 


float:left/right/none/inherit:specifies how an element should float. 

clear:none/left/right/both/inherit:  When we use the   float  property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the   clear  property. The   clear  property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element. 

none  - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default

left  - The element is pushed below left floated elements

right  - The element is pushed below right floated elements

both  - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements

inherit  - The element inherits the clear value from its parent.
