; : It startsd the one line comments.54

DWORD: Defines 32 bits for the value on left .55

stc :   sets the carry flag.  61

inc: Has one operand and adds 1 to the operand. E.g: inc eax.61

imul: The instruction has three operands in which the first operand is the destination and the following two operands are source operands which are multiplied together.62



.386 : Identifies the program as a 32 bit one that can access 32 bit registers and addresses.63

.model flat,stdcall:  identifies the memory model of the program.In 32-bit programs, we always use the flat memory model, which is associated with the processor's protected mode.63

 flat : A possible memory model for programs.63

stdcall: a calling convention required for 32 Windows services applications.63

.stack: Used to specify the number of bytes that are  needed for runtime stack.63

Procedurename PROTO, parameter:parametersize:
A  procedure prototype.64

main PROC: It defines the procedure and its beginning.64

main ENDP: Marks the end of a procedure.65

END main: Marks the end of the program and references the program ENTRY POINT.If you add any more lines to a program after the END directive, they will be ignored by the
assembler. You can put anything there
program comments, copies of your code, etc.It doesn’t matter.65

INVOKE procedure name,parameter:
Invokes the procedure .63

? : This initializer leaves the variable uninitialized.77
NAME DIRECTIVE INITIALIZER [INITIALIZER1,initializer2,initializer3]:
This is how we define variables. Were we to continue the definition on the next line, we have to re state the directive again before the initializers.77

DUP() : Is an operator (function,LITERALLY) that assigns the value in the parentheses after it.
The DUP operator allocates storage for multiple data items, using a integer expression as a counter. 78

CONSTANTNAME =  value: Used to define constants.84
