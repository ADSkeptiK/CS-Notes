2. Relative URL  - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip:  It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.*******

INLINE AND BLOCK

******* Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
The two most common display values are block and inline.*******

*******Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).Two commonly used block elements are:
<p>  and <div>.The <p>  element defines a
paragraph in an HTML document.The <div> 
element defines a division or a section in an HTML
document.*******
*******
Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
address > < article > < aside > < blockquote >
<canvas > < dd > < div > < dl > < dt > < fieldset >
< figcaption > < figure > < footer > < form > < h1 > -<
h6 > < header > < hr > < li > < main > < nav >
<noscript > < ol > < p > < pre > < section > < table >
<tfoot > < ul > < video > *******

******* Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line. An
inline element only takes up as much width as
necessary.This is a <span> element inside   a
paragraph.*******

******* Here are the inline elements in HTML: < a >
<abbr > < acronym > < b > < bdo > < big > < br >
<button > < cite > < code > < dfn > < em > < i > <img> < input > < kbd > < label > < map > < object >
< output > < q > < samp > < script > < select >
< small > < span > < strong > < sub > < sup >
< textarea > < time > < tt > < var > *******


********An inline element cannot contain a block-level element! *******

DIV

******* A div element that is not 100% wide can be centered if we set margin to auto*******

******* The CSS   float  property is used for positioning and formatting content and allow elements float next to each other instead of on top of each other. *******

******* <div>  element's   display  property from   block  to   inline-block, the   <div>  elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other. *******


******* The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div>  elements with another
<div>  element and give it the status as a flex container.*******


*******The CSS grid method requires that you surround the   <div>  elements with another   <div>  element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column. ******

*******HTML elements can belong to more than one class.To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.*******
