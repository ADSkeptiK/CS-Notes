Modules: Largest building blocks for
program. They are simply binaryies that
contain isolated areas of program's
executable. They can be catagorized to 2
groups.

 Static Libraries: Are added to program
      during linkage.They become an
      integrated part.

 Dynamic Libraries: (DLL)s in Windows. They are NOT integrated within program but will still remain a separate part during shipment.It allows to update individual parts without having to recompile the entire thing.28
