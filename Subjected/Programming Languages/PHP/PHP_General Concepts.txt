******* Webserver: Handles the requests.*******

******* Servers either use Linux OS or Windows.******

******* Apache webserver is quite famous.Nginx resource ultilization is far lower and uses other engines to perform its tasks it, it's more optimized.IIS from microsoft is also good for those who want to use ASP.Net*******

*****When client searchs for a website first a DNS protocls find the address of the server and then uses the IP protocol to send its requests.*******

******* Servers have different ports for different uses for example: MySQL uses 3306,Nginx 80 or 443,Cpanel 2082 and ftp 21 by default. When you send the request to each of these ports it would react differently.Everytime we search for the address of a website we're sending the request to http://www.name.com : 80 or https://www.name.com : 443 *******


******************* In IPv 4 we use 32 bit (4byte) IP addresses, they have 4 segments each segment represents a byte (8 bits ) and therefore able to cover a sum of 255 different values(2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2) while in IPv6 we use 128 bit IP addresses (16bytes), we have8 segments each segment representing 2bytes and containing 4 Hexadecimal numbers (each Hexadecimal number is 4 bits).******************
