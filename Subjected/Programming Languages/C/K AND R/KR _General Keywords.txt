Declaration: Announces the properties of variables.9

Text Stream: Sequence of characters divided into lines each line consists of one or more character followed by a newline character.16

Symbolic Constant: Is a way to systemically change the magic number.15

Constant Expression: Is an expression that involves only constants. Such expressions may be evaluated during compilation rather than runtime and accordingly may be used in any place that a constants can occur.38

String Constant: Is a sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes as in "Sdapdik"  or "" the quotes are 


not a part of string but seerve only to delimit it. The same escape sequences used in character constants can be concatenated at compile time.38

Enumeration Constant: An enumeration is a list of constant integer values. The values of the identifiers within the  enumaration are started from 0 and incremented by one from left to right by default, unless they're explicitly specified.39

Declaration: Specifies a type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type.40

Typecast: The precise meaning of a cast 
is as if the  expression were assigned to a variable of the specified type, which is then used in place of the whole construction.45



Compound Statement / block: Statements put /grouped together  and regarded as one by brackets.55

External Linkage: All references to them by the same name, even from functions compiled separately are references to the same thing.The standard calls this property external linkage.73 

Preprocessor: C provides certain language facilities by means of a preprocessor, which is conceptually a separate first step in compilation. 88

Pointer: A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.They are much used in C , partly because they are sometimes the only way to express  a computation and partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient



code than can be obtained in other
ways.93

Structure: Is a collection of variables possibly of different types under a single name for convenient handling.127
